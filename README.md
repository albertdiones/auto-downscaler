A simple automatic downscaler that I can use for Davinci Resolve proxy

There should a config yaml that will choose which folders and files are gonna be downscaled

downscale.py:
   # Should check the files from the source folder
   # Then check if it exists on the target folder
   # If it doesn't exist, downscale it using Handbrake
   # If it exists, skip


I expect this will speed up Davinci resolve's shuttle and scroll function
